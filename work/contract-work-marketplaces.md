I've been on a quest for the last few weeks to find the best contract work marketplace. I've tried a laundry list of them: Elance, Odesk/Upwork, Freelancer, Gun.io, Guru, and Crew.

I've bid on many, many projects, and only landed jobs so far where I've underbid my normal rates, usually by 50%. And most of the time, I don't even think my proposal gets read, let along considered.
In order to stand out from the crowd, there is one hack that has helped me improve my response rate on these sites: record and submit a short video proposal, and in your proposal, post a link to it in the first sentence.
This one trick has vastly improved the attention I've been getting on these sites, but most of the clients taht respond are still looking for cut-rate, race-to-the-bottom developers.

Short of spending hundreds of cut-rate hours on these platforms, building a 5-star reputation, and dealing with clients who don't have any idea what quality development costs, I don't know how to rapidly succeed on any of the existing contract work marketplaces.
I've started cold-emailing HackerNews companies via their monthly job posting thread, and this has started yielding better clients, but why is the contract work marketplace not a solved problem?

I'm hoping [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/javascript) may be the answer. I expect to be screened thoroughly, and impressed that their application asks for much more detail than any of the others thus far. No other marketplace has even required a code sample.
The list of Javascript engineers looks impressive, and I would love to find out what their how effective the community is for landing quality clients in the long run.

I'm still searching for the perfect outlet for my voracious appitite to do worthwhile side-project work on paying contracts. What do you think, have you found a great community I've missed? Let me know in the comments or reach out to me at andrew@brassington.io
