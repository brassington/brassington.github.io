## Background

I am a software developer with experience using C#, ASP.NET, Javascript, and Angular.js. I enjoy experimenting with new tools/languages to expand my knowledge and I believe that teaching others to share in a love for learning is the most important aspect of any profession, but especially as a developer.

I strive to be a quick learner and both a competent leader and capable worker. In my free time I enjoy cycling, playing the tuba, hiking, reading, and spending time with my wife. I'd like to contribute more to open source projects.

## Education

Business Administration, B.S.    
Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan  

## Proficiency

I have been writing basic HTML/CSS, running linux servers and experimenting with new software since middle school in 2002. Most recently the majority of code I have written has been in C#, ASP.NET, Javascript, and Angular.js. I have limited experience in Ruby, Python, Bash, and SQL.
